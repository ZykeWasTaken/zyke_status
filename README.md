## Severity For Effects

-   Ability to alter the effect based on severity, if configured. For example, your walking is more sloppy the drunker you are.

## Severity For Queues

-   Stack all the active for a queued key, and alter the severity based on the total value. If your screen is blurred because of 3 different effects, it should be n / 2 as bad.
