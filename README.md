# Information

This resource is a work-in-progress status system meant to elevate how your character processes hunger, thirst, stress, addictions, highs and much more. It also has a versatile and dynamic effect system to queue and stack effects to prevent interruptions when using different resources requiring different effects.

Full backwards compatibility is available for ESX, QBCore & Qbox to avoid having to change other resources to fit our needs.

The idea of this resource was manifested by our current developments for zyke_consumables. We needed an alternative that could handle all the statuses and effects we would like to have, along with a queue system to not fight what should be active between consumables and our smoking resource.

## Setup

We have a first iteration of an installation guide available in our documentation, found [here](https://docs.zykeresources.com/free-resources/status/setup). If there is anything missing, or it doesn't work properly, don't hesitate to contact us on Discord and we will swiftly resolve it.

# Planned TODO

## Outside Use
-	Elevate the documentation & exports for outside use of the resource. Currently it's difficult to get started with just the guidance of our documentation for developers wanting to integrate this into their own resources.

## More Statuses
-   Anxiety, pains and whatnot that is suggested or thought of will be added in the near future.
