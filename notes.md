<!-- Basics -->
- Lightweight status system to just handle the backend of statuses.
- Have a base function to create a status to keep track of.
- A separate file for each status type, where you use the function to inject the base, then all the extra functionality is separated into it's own file.
- With a lightweight setup to just handle the backend in this fashion, it is easy to configure as needed.
